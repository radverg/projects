 * @brief The Stop class. Holds basic information about a stop - name and position.
 *
 * As well as Street, this class is more like a "primitive" data type.
 * It is not meant to be allocated dynamically.
 * Basically it represents a simple point with extra information like name, street name and relative position.
 * Since this is simple type, it does not contain any direct link to the related street, but stores ID of the related street instead.
 * This approach offers more flexibility when working with Streets and Stops.
