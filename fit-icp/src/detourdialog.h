 * Detour dialog is opened with push button in mainwindow and linearly progresses through:
 * - Selection of which street to close
 * - Selection of streets that mark the new route to the closed street.
 *
 * After the selection is made, the detour is set as closed street's attribute.
 * User also has an option to reset the detour selection or close the window.
