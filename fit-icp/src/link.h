/**
 * @brief The Link class. Represents one travel over a route.
 *
 * From the beginning, object of this class is tightly bound to a route.
 * The main differences of Route and Link:
 * - Route defines path on a map.
 * - Link defines one travel over specific Route from given start time to given end time.
 * In other words, link can represent one vehicle on a route at a specific time.
 * More Links can be bound to a single route or it's reversed route.
 * The main difference is also that link works with time and current distance, that changes over time and simulates movement,
 * whereas Route just defines a path for a link.
