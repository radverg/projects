 * @brief The Route class.
 *
 * This class represents a route on a map.
 * Route consists of:
 * - Unique identifier
 * - Ordered list of streets. Street is a "primitive type", that is not allocated dynamically and is copied instead. It basically represents a line.
 * - Ordered list of stops. Stop is a "primitive type" as well. Stop always belongs to one street.
 *
 * Initializing route with streets and stops and several other tasks are done by friend class RouteBuilder,
 * since these task are not trivial and would make this class complicated and confusing.

 * @see Stop
