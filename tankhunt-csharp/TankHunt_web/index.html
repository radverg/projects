        <section>
           <p>Hello, my name is Radek Veverka and I am from Czech republic. This website is about my game called "Tank hunt" developed using C# programming language with XNA framework and Lidgren-Network library.
           It is a 2D game with very simple graphics where players fight each other using their tanks in randomly generated labyrinth battlefield.
           This game is multiplayer-only and it's really fun to play with your friends, during a skype call.
           However, I am not a professional programer - the game contains a lot of bugs which I couldn't fix out yet, due to lack of time, strength or skill.
           These bugs don't make the game unplayable though.</p>

          <h2> How to correctly setup a server: </h2>
        </header>
        <section>
           <p>You can create a server and tell your friends to connect there, but creating connectable server
           requires two setups below.</p>
           <p>1) You need to allow your application in the windows firewall. Windows will usually ask you to this while creating the server, but if it doesn't,
           follow this: </p>
           <p>
           - Open the control panel. <br>
           - Select &quotSystem and security.&quot <br>
           - Under Windows firewall link, clik on sublink &quotAllow an app through Windows firewall&quot. <br>
           - Click on &quotChange setting&quot, then on &quotChoose another app&quot and find TankHunt.exe. <br>
           </p>
           <p>2) You need forward used port to your local ip address, after that, unlocal players can connect through your external ip. This is not required for lan play. </p>
           <p>
            - Press Winkey + R   <br>
            - Type there &quotcmd&quot and run it. <br>
            - Write &quotipconfig&quot to command line and press enter.<br>
            - Find default gateway address, write it into address line in your internet browser. <br>
            - Insert your router username and password (you should know it, if you don't, try defaults). <br>
            - Find for these buttons: Port forwarding, Virtual server, NAT (each router has different one). Click on it. <br>
            - There set your port for server and your local ip address, which you can also find in that cmd (Ipv4 address). Select UDP protocol.<br>
            - That's it, players now will be able to connect to your server if they use your external ip. You can find more detailed information here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wikihow.com/Set-Up-Port-Forwarding-on-a-Router">http://www.wikihow.com/Set-Up-Port-Forwarding-on-a-Router</a>
