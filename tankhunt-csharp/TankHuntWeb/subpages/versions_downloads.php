        </header>
        <section>
            After a long pause I've decided to move on and finally finish the most difficult weapon : guided rocket. This will be probably the final version of TankHunt.
            <li><b>Guided rocket has been added: After few seconds after shot, this missile will always follow the nearest player, even when target is invisible. This shot
                    cannot go through walls and will disappear after 15 seconds.</b></li>
                    <li>Tombs are added into the game. If someone dies, tomb will appear at this place colored to the color of dead player.</li>
                    <li>Server creator (or leader of the game running on external server) can set percentage probabilities determinig how much should different items spawn.</li>
                    <li>Now, when shots go completely wrong way for some player, their position and rotation will be refreshed according to owners of these shots.</li>
            <br>

            <li>Observer mode: In observer mode, players see invisible players and mines, can move with camera and see all in dark level, observer can decide to play in the next level or stay as observer. Every player 
            go to the observer mode after death, or you can commit suicide and go to the mode by pressing P key. This will subtract one kill from your total kills though.
            Observer mode is good to use as pause. </li>
            <li>Tank never shows up while starting new level. (this was caused by invisibility used before level switch) </li>
